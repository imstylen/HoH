# Notes:
- Igira's mele's also hit the next closest player. Tanks must stack.
- Taunt swap on drenching blades
- Blistering spear
    - When players get stuck to ground with spear, quickly kill the spears.
    - Spears give Igara energy
- Watch frontal (twisting blade)
- Torments: (100% energy)
    - there are 3 dead things around the room with 1 weapon each.
    - During "marked for torment", players must soak one weapon until circle is gone. This gives igara another ability. soaking gives a debuff so you cannot soak multiple times.
        - Hacking Torment:
        - Slicing torment:
        - Flaying Torment:
