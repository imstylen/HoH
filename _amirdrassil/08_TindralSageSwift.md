- On all platforms:
  - Tanks soak big mushrooms
  - Staking debuff on mele strikes that is taunt swap.
  - Fire pools healing absorb/dispell?
- On the first platform,
  - Stack to kill entangling roots
  - (Moonkin form) Dodge sunfire tornado 
  - pick up feather to dragonride to next platform
    - Green orbs good. give buff.
    - Red orbs bad. take vigor and damage.
- On the second platform,
  - When you get there, he has a big shield that you have to break before his cast finishes. 
  - Everyone soak small mushrooms
  - feathers > dragonriding again
- On the third platform,
  - Again, break the shield to stop the cast.
  -  he will cast everything from the first and second platform.
